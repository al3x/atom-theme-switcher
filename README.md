# Atom Theme Switcher

Switches between one set of syntax and UI theme and another when you hit a key. Ideal for themes like Solarized that provide both light and dark versions that you may want to switch to under different lighting conditions.

You can override the defaults in the package settings. Use the package names of the syntax and UI themes (ex: "unity-ui").

Mapped to F12 by default.
